=head1 NAME

App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Plaintext - check a page's text without markup


=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Plaintext version 1.00


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Normal test specs use the entire HTML text
    http://perl.org/ /books<\/a>\n \| / Y Sites list HTML

    # If we want to match just the text, not the HTML:
    %%plaintext on
    http://perl.org/  /|books \| dev \| history \| jobs/ Y Literal list

    # And we can turn this back off again:
    %%plaintext off

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin adds the C<%%plaintext> pragma. This allows you to write test
specs that match the visible text on a page, as opposed to the HTML text.
This is useful if you want to make sure (for instance) if specific text
is on the page, but you don't care how it's marked up.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 pragmas

Exports the C<%%plaintext> pragma handler to C<App::SimpleScan>.

=head2 plaintext_pragma

Actually handles the pragma statement. Calls the exported C<plaintext>
method to record the current state (on or off).

=head2 filters

Standard C<App::SimpleScan> callback; returns the code filters.

=head2 filter

If the C<plaintext> method returns true, we alter the tests to
use text_like and text_unlike instead of page_like and 
page_unlike. In eitehr case, we return the code to the
caller (standard interface).

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Invalid argument for %%plaintext: %s >>

You supplied an argument other than '1' or 'on' to turn
plaintext processing on, or '0' or 'off' to turn it off.
